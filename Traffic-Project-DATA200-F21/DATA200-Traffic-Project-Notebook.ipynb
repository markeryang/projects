    "# Data 100 Final Project: Traffic in a post-lockdown world\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're a data scientist at Uber -- sitting in a war room on March 16, 2020, 1 day after California-wide COVID lockdown measures began and the day shelter-in-place measures are announced in the bay area. The entire data science department is on fire: All of your existing traffic models have regressed *significantly*. Given the sudden change in traffic patterns (i.e., no traffic at all), the company's traffic estimates are wildly incorrect. This is a top priority for the company. Since traffic estimates are used directly for pricing strategies, this is actively costing the company millions every hour. You are tasked with fixing these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaways:** How do you \"fix\" models that have learned biases from pre-lockdown traffic? How do you train new ones, with just 24 hours of data? What sorts of data do you examine, to better understand the situation? In the midst of company-wide panic, you'll need a strong inferential acumen to lead a robust data science response. In this project, we'll walk you through a simulated war room data science effort, culminating in some strategies to fix models online, which are experiencing large distributional shifts in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we'll explore traffic data provided by the **Uber Movement** dataset, specifically around the start of COVID shutdowns in March 2020. Your project is structured around the following ideas:\n",

    "```\n",

    "        ii. Visualize change in average daily speeds pre vs. post lockdown.\n",
    "        iii. Quantify the impact of lockdown on daily speeds, spatially.\n",

    "        ii. Report model performance temporally\n",
    "    c. \"Fix\" model on post-lockdown data\n",
    "        i. Learn delta off of a moving bias\n",
    "        ii. Does it \"solve itself\"? Does the pre-lockdown model predict, after the change point?\n",
    "        iii. Naively retrain model with post-lockdown data\n",
